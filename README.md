# Data Quality Management System elements
The Data Quality Management System follows the approach of applying ISO 9001 to data quality. The terms for the
elements used in ISO 9001 are converted to terms that are common in the data domain. The meaning
of each of these elements is then briefly explained. The aim of this is to make it easier to apply ISO
9001 to the management of data quality.
